While this *technically* resides outside of .NET OSS per se, it's a valuable signal on the viability of Linux desktop as a general-purpose operating system for PCs.

## Mythbusting without the budget

There's a common myth out there that "Linux is only for software developers" (and by implication, is inherently difficult to operate). While I think that's manifestly not true, it's sometimes difficult to shift the conversation without a clear independent signal that affirms that stance.

## Enter Mike Kelly

Mike Kelly is the CTO of [MemberVault](https://membervault.co), a platform that provides a variety of member services offerings, including courseware, membership, workshop and Coaching management. He posted a thread on X about his experience with re-imaging and donating discarded/donated laptops.

{{< tweet user="mikecodemonkey" id="1798729302110044164" >}}

The following posts in that thread revealed the following:

1. Once you got the computer, was it easy to start using right away?

      100% said yes

2. Did you have to install any new apps? Did that work easily for you too?

      80% didn't need anything else installed (Mike only added chrome, zoom and supertuxkart)

      20% did add apps and found it easy via the app center

3. Are you still using the laptop?  And if not, how long did you use it?

      92% said they were still using it to this day.

      The remaining 8% reported having it stolen or physically breaking it.

This is gratifying to see, not only because of the "proof" it provides for what I presume to be a relatively *novice* user group (i.e. not computer or software engineers) but also because of the continued value that it brings to long-lived hardware. üêß ‚ù§Ô∏è üíª

As you can see above he also provides a quick walk-through navigating the desktop and introduces users to Flathub as an app delivery resource. This is a brilliant example of how local, ground-up community engagement can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people who would be skipped over by the trillion-dollar valued corporations. 

This is not only smart, it's also good.

*Thank you, Mike!*
