# .NET on Linux üêß ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is a Hugo-based site that is deployed to Cloudflare Pages automatically when a change is made on a branch. Contributions are welcome! You'll need to install [Hugo 'extended'](https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/) and then of course clone this repository. Check out the "stage" branch and write your post in Markdown format. You *can* make other site mods if you're experienced but I'm likely to cherry pick the content only *unless* there's a reasonably detailed explanation for the change to the site in the PR. And as per usual, submit a PR and it will get a quick review - once it's in stage and reviewed "live" on that site I'll merge the code into main and it'll go out to the main site.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

While I've done some pretty significant Hugo modifications for a site I built with R markdown, those mods require a bit of adjustment to bring them into line with the latest version of Hugo (and to dovetail into the current template). Once those updates are made there will both be entries in the site itself and some additional notes here on how to use them (and in certain cases tooling I'll provide from the SpeakEZ lab) to help smooth out some of Hugo's rough edges.

I have opened up discussion in the repo to gather feedback and help the site to expand and grow. So if you want to bring up a topic without opening an issue or submitting a PR, feel free to use that as a place to make your ideas known! Thanks! üôè

## The Future is Open üìñ

The desire for this site is to be accepting of all good faith submissions. That said, the emphasis will be on multi-platform tools and applications and advice around the Linux platform. There are plenty of outlets for corporate marketing, so the bias here is to focus on being an *alternative* to the üì£ usual channels and provide fertile ground for independent voices outside of the Microsoft sphere of influence. This *doesn't* mean that this site is anti-anything - and certainly not anti-Azure or anti-Windows. The point is to provide a clear-eyed view of the large ecosystem that has grown up around .NET both because of and *in spite of* Microsoft's position in the technology marketplace.
